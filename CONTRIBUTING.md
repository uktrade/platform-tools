# Contributing to Platform Tools

We welcome contributions from engineers in other teams at the Department for Business and Trade.

If you've found something trivial, such as a typo, please submit a pull request and we will be alerted to review it.

Other changes need to be discussed before you make any changes to ensure that they align with the vision for DBT Platform.

Please start that initial discussion via the #platform-requests Slack channel.
